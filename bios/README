The [bios] module contains the assembly code
necessary to boot using BIOS. This code is linked
at the beginning of the resulting disk file.

This module also defines the bios_call function with
the purpose of being able to call BIOS services from
long mode, as well as various boot time constants such
as defined by the linker.
